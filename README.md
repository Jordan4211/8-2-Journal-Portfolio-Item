## Reflection Journal

#### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To figure out what users need and turn that into a program, I listen to what they’re asking for and break it down into easy tasks, which we call "user stories." These stories keep the team on track and make sure we’re building something useful. They help us stay focused on what really matters to the user.

#### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I’m working on a project, I like to plan things out, get the coding done, test it, and then review how it all came together. I’m a fan of using Agile methods, like getting feedback often, working in short bursts, and having regular check-ins with the team. These things help us keep moving forward and make changes quickly if something isn’t working.

#### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means you’re reliable, you communicate well, and you’re cool with getting and giving feedback. It’s about working together, sharing ideas, and pitching in when needed. You’ve got to listen to others, respect different opinions, and be ready to roll with changes because things can switch up fast in this field.
